## Building-an-Interactive-User-Interface-for-the-Classification-Model-with-Gradio
In this project, I used the Gradio library to build a graphical user interface (GUI) for one of my previous projects where I worked on predicting customer churn using a classification model. The main objective of this project was aimed to predict customer churn based on different input parameters.

## Deployment
After I completed this project, I went ahead to deploy the app to Hugging Face. Here is a link to access it "https://huggingface.co/spaces/Aliyyah/Gradio-Prediction-Of-Customer-Churn-App".
